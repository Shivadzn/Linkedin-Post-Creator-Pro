      "text": "Zuck is not playing around anymore.\n\nAt first, Meta tried to block the wins of OpenAI, Apple, and Google by going open-source with models like LLaMA trying to shape the game by being the open alternative.\n\nBut now, it's clear: Zuck knows that if Meta has to lead in the AI race, just shipping open-source models won't cut it.\n\nThey're losing the edge in product quality. LLaMA, Instagram's AI features, anything Meta's shipped, it's nowhere close to GPT, Claude, or even Perplexity.\n\nWhat does Zuck do next?\n\nHe does what he's always done: hires.\n\nBrings in ex-OpenAI engineers. Builds a Superintelligence team.\n\nAnd yes, he's going all-in.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple's reportedly in talks to buy Perplexity.\n\nThis isn't just OpenAI vs Google anymore.\n\nIt's Apple vs Meta again. The same battle, a new arena.\n\nHonestly, watching Zuck's evolution over the last few years from the metaverse rabbit hole to now being super calculated and public-facing in AI is fascinating. He's grown. He's adapting.\n\nThis AI race isn't just about models anymore. It's about:\n\n-Teams.\n\n-Distribution.\n\n-Interfaces.\n\nAnd most interestingly, who builds the first AI-first social platform.\n\nI do believe one will exist.\n\nI don't know what it will look like yet because if I did, I'd be building it already.\n\nBut I'll be watching. And if I get any signal, I'm jumping in.\n\nLet the game begin. 🧠🔥",

Just a layer on top of other people's platforms.\n\nThat's dangerous when you're building the most important interface shift in decades.\n\nAnd with Jony Ive entering the scene, something is much more imminent\n\nOpenAI isn't just rethinking UX. It's rethinking the entire device.\n\nBecause also a huge truth is, smartphone form factor was never meant for ambient, AI-first interaction.\n\nAltman's vision points toward something else:\n- AI that's aware of your environment\n- Context-rich, voice-first, gesture-ready\n- Less app-hopping, more fluid assistance\n- A complete departure from glass rectangles and thumbs\n\nIf you want to win AI, you can't just own the model.\n\nYou have to own the medium. The interface. The distribution. That's what this move is about.\n\nWe're watching the beginning of OpenAI's attempt to become the next Apple, but for AI.\n\n#AI #OpenAI",

That was my 1st time experiencing that city, and yes, it was amazing.\n\nWhen I was back in Goa, I was super pumped, energised, and was with full hunger to kill it, focused next 2 months building a significantly good product.\n\nGuess what? it had a lot of go-to-market issues, spent the next 4-5 months in self-doubt, understanding what else to build, and still trying to make it work.\n\nNow, cut to April 2025, we have little light of hope. We saw potential with the problem to solve, but the solution we had built back then was still a major issue, so we thought to change the way we solved this.\n\nBy May end, we had a network of 50000+ creators across India, with interest from a few brands to test and use it.\n\nYes, it felt like a win, and I wanted to tell everyone that I am the next big thing that has happened to the startup ecosystem.\n\nBut that's exactly not where the story ends with a happy ending. What happens next is a good question to have, and you will have the answer to it in my next post. Till then, keep building, keep doing crazy stuff",

Your customers will lie to you (unintentionally)\n\nThey'll say they love your product in interviews, but their actions tell a different story. Track behavior, not words.\n\n2. Product-market fit feels like drowning in demand\n\nYou'll know you have it when you can't keep up with customer requests. Until then, you're still searching.\n\n3. The market decides your product, not you\n\nI thought I was building a productivity app. Turns out, I was building a team communication tool. The market taught me what I was actually making.\n\n4. Timing beats everything\n\nA good product at the right time beats a great product at the wrong time. Pay attention to market winds.\n\n5. Distribution is product\n\nHow people discover and adopt your product IS your product. Build distribution into your core experience.\n\nThe hardest part about entrepreneurship isn't building.\n\nIt's knowing when to pivot and when to persevere.\n\nWhat's your biggest product lesson? 👇",
